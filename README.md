## Hey, I'm Sam Burkhard

I'm a passionate third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, delving into the realms of technology with enthusiasm. My love for coding competitions led me to participate in Apple's [Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/), where I secured victories and honed my skills.

Currently, pursuing my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Engineering at UC. Beyond academia, you'll often find me engrossed in tech literature, exploring the latest trends and innovations.
